@article{Chamizo2014,
abstract = {This paper attempts to show one of the ways history of chemistry can be teachable for chemistry teachers, it means something more than an undifferentiated mass of names and dates, establishing a temporal framework based on chemical entities that all students use. Represents a difficult equilibrium between over-simplification versus over-elaboration. Hence, following the initial proposal of Jensen (J Chem Educ 75:679--687, 817--828, 961--969, 1998), reconstructs the history of one of chemistry' dimensions (composition-structure) in terms of three revolutionary moments. These moments are considered in terms of the Kuhnian notion of `exemplar,' rather than `paradigm.' This approach enables the incorporation of instruments, as well as concepts into the revolutionary process and provides a more adequate representation of such periods of development and consolidation. These three revolutions are called by the chemical structural entities that emerged from the same: atoms (1766--1808); molecules and isomers (1831--1860); electrons and isotopes (1897--1923).},

@article{Boryło2010,
abstract = {In the paper was presented results of our study about uranium 234U and 238U radioactivity in the marine birds samples, collected in the Polish area of the southern Baltic Sea. We chose 11 species of sea birds: three species permanently residing at southern Baltic, four species of wintering birds and three species of migrating birds. The obtained results indicated that uranium is very irregularly distributed in organs and tissues of marine birds. The highest uranium content is characterized in liver, rest of viscera and feathers, the smallest in skin and muscles. The uranium concentration was higher for carnivorous species (long-tailed duck (C. hyemalis), common eider (S. mollissima), lower for species eating fish (great cormorant (P. carbo), common guillemot (U. aalge), red-throated diver (G. stellata) and razorbill (A. tarda)), but the biggest amounts for herbivorous species [tufted duck (A. fuligula) and eurasian coot (F. atra)]. About 63--67{\%} of uranium, which was located in feathers of two species of marine birds: razorbill (A. tarda) and long-tailed duck (C. hymealis), was apparently adsorbed, which suggests that uranium adsorption on the feathers may be an important transfer from air to water.},

abstract = {In this research, the adsorption behaviors of two important fission product radionuclides (137Cs and 133Ba) onto sodium form of insolubilized humic acid (INaA) were investigated as a function of time, cation concentration and temperature, utilizing radiotracer method. The resulting data was fitted well to the Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. Thermodynamic constants such as; free energy ({\$}\Delta{\$}G ads), enthalpy ({\$}\Delta{\$}H ads), entropy ({\$}\Delta{\$}S ads) of adsorption were determined. Temperature change didn't effect sorption processes significantly. Best fitting kinetic models were found for a better understanding of adsorption mechanisms. It was found that Ba2+ was adsorbed five times more than Cs+ onto structurally modified humic acid and kinetic studies indicated that adsorption behaviors of both ions obey the pseudo second order rate law. The effect of pH changes on adsorption was also examined and optimum pH range was found in the range of pH 6--8. FTIR and solid state carbon nmr (13CNMR) spectroscopic techniques were used to understand the structural changes during insolubilization process. Quantitative determination of adsorption sites was carried out using potentiometric titration method and the resulting data was treated by using appropriate Gran functions.},
